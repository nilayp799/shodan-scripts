Welcome to the Shodan Scripts repository! Here, you will find a collection of custom scripts designed to help you use Shodan more efficiently and even add a bit of fun to your exploration.

## What is Shodan?

[Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/) is a powerful search engine for internet-connected devices, services, and even vulnerable systems. It allows you to explore the Internet of Things (IoT) and discover various devices, servers, and more. Shodan is an invaluable tool for security researchers, network administrators, and anyone interested in understanding the exposed online world.

## Getting Started

To make the most of these scripts, you'll need to have Python and the Shodan Python library installed on your system. If you haven't already installed them, you can do so by following the steps below:

1. **Install Python:** If you don't have Python installed, download the latest version from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Install Shodan Python Library:** Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the Shodan library:
  ```bash
pip install shodan
```

3. **Get Shodan API Key:** To use these scripts, you'll need a Shodan API key. If you don't have one, sign up for a free account at [https://www.shodan.io/](https://www.shodan.io/) and generate your API key from the dashboard.

## Using the Scripts

Clone or download this repository to your local machine to access the scripts. Before running any script, ensure you have set up the Shodan API key as an environment variable or configure it within the scripts themselves.
